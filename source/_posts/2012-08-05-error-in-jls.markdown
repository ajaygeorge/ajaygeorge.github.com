There was an interesting question on SO regarding the JLS. 
{% blockquote StackOverflow http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11638627/is-a-member-interface-in-a-class-declaration-implicitly-public/ Link %}
Is a member interface in a class declaration implicitly public?
{% endblockquote %}

I got to answer the question correctly.
Turns out the JLS was indeed wrong !.
